### 문제 설명

<p>You’re writing the positive integers in increasing order starting from one. But you’ve never learned the digit zero, and thus omit any number that contains a zero in any position. The first ten integers you write are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 11.</p>

<p>You have just written down the integer n (which is guaranteed to not contain the digit zero). What will be the next integer that you write down?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input consists of a single line containing the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 999,999).</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that n does not contain the digit zero.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print, on a single line, the next integer you will be writing down.</p>
