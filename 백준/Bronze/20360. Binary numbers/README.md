### 문제 설명

<p>Given a positive integer n, find the positions of all 1’s in its binary representation. The position of the least significant bit is 0.</p>

<p>Write a program that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>reads a positive integer n from the standard input,</li>
	<li>computes the positions of 1’s in the binary representation of n,</li>
	<li>writes the result to the standard output.</li>
</ul>

### 입력 

 <p>The first and only line of the input contains exactly one integer n, 1 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>The output should contain increasing sequence of integers separated by single spaces — the positions of 1’s in the binary representation of the input number.</p>
