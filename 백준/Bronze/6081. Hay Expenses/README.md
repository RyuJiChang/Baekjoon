### 문제 설명

<p>Every day Farmer John feeds the cows a lavish meal of premium gourmet hay. He then records the number of bales on the next line of his expense notebook.</p>

<p>When tax time comes, FJ realizes that he neglected to record the dates for the hay feedings. He must calculate a number of different totals of successive hay feedings in order to solve the puzzle of which feedings went with which month of expenses.</p>

<p>FJ has created a dataset with N (4 <= N <= 500) days conveniently numbered 1..N of hay bale counts H_i (1 <= H_i <= 1,000). He has an additional Q (1 <= Q <= 500) queries -- each query is a pair of integers S_j and E_j (1 <= S_j <= E_j <= N) that denote that start and end indices of some hay bale counts.  Your job is to sum the hay bale counts for the days S_j..E_j (inclusive) and report one sum for each query.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and Q</li>
	<li>Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single hay bale count for day i: H_i</li>
	<li>Lines N+2..N+Q+1: Line j+N+1 describes query j with a pair of integers: S_j and E_j</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

### 출력 

 <ul>
	<li>Lines 1..Q: Line j of the output file contains a single integer that is the sum of the hay bale counts for days S_j through E_j</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
