### 문제 설명

<p>Did you konw taht the hamun biran is so celevr taht it can raed a steennce lkie tihs as lnog as ecah wrod has the coercrt leetrts and the frsit and lsat ltrtees are ceorcrt?</p>

<p>I'll translate! Did you know that the human brain is so clever that it can read a sentence like this as long as each word has the correct letters and the first and last letters are correct?</p>

<p>If you understood the sentence first time, you proved the point. In this problem you will be given normal words and will have to jumble them by reversing all letters within the word, keeping the first and last letters in the correct place. Our test sentence would have to look like this:</p>

<p>Did you konw taht the hamun biarn is so cevelr taht it can raed a scnetnee lkie tihs as lnog as ecah wrod has the ccerrot lrettes and the fsrit and lsat lrettes are ccerrot? </p>

### 입력 

 <p>Input consists of a number of lines of text each containing no more than 250 characters. The text will consist of lower case letters and spaces only. There will be a single space between each word, but no leading or trailing spaces. The last line will contain just the character # - this line should not be processed. </p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output will be one line of text for every input line. In the output line all letters within each word will have been reversed, except for the first and last letters, which will be unchanged. </p>
