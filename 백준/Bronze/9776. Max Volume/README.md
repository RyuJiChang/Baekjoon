### 문제 설명

<p>Write a program to find the maximum volume of given geometric 3-dimensional figures. Here, there are 3 types of figures: cone, cylinder and sphere.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="https://upload.acmicpc.net/51b9d0e5-fefc-4841-bd7f-9da111450728/-/preview/" style="width: 485px; height: 202px;"></p>

<p>The volume (V) of each figure can be calculated by the following formulas.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cone: V = (1/3)πr<sup>2</sup>h</li>
	<li>Cylinder: V = πr<sup>2</sup>h</li>
	<li>Sphere: V = (4/3)πr<sup>3</sup></li>
</ul>

<p>Use the value π = 3.14159 in your calculation.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) which is the number of figures. The n following lines contain the description of each figure. In case of a cone, the line begins with letter C and followed by 2 values: r and h respectively. If it is a cylinder, the line begins with letter L and followed by 2 values: r and h respectively. If it is a sphere, the line begins with letter S and followed by only one value which is r.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Print out the max volume among the input figures with 3 decimal places</p>
