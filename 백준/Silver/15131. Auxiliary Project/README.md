### 문제 설명

<p>Anna has just finished her course project. She has a lot of seven-segment LED displays as leftovers and a small power source. Each display consumes power proportionally to the number of lit segments, e.g. ‘9’ consumes twice more power than ‘7’.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src="https://onlinejudgeimages.s3-ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com/problem/15131/1.png" style="height:58px; width:375px"></p>

<p>Anna wonders what is the maximum possible sum of digits she is able to achieve, if her power source is able to light n segments, and she wants to light exactly n segments.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The single line of the input contains one integer n — the number of segments that should be lit (2 ≤ n ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Output a single integer — the maximum possible sum of digits that can be displayed simultaneously.</p>
