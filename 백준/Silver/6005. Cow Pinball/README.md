### 문제 설명

<p>The cows are playing that cool Japanese 'pinball' game called Pachinko. You've probably seen it, you drop a ball in the top and it hits nails on the way down, veering just a little left or right, until the ball comes out the bottom.</p>

<p>This pachinko game is special: the ball always hits the top nail of the R rows of nails (1 <= R <= 25) and then will hit either the right or left nail underneath that.  From there, the ball can hit the next nail that's just a bit lower and to the left or right of the second nail, and so on. The ball never veers too far (i.e., more than 1/2 nail away) from the nail it just hit.</p>

<p>This game also has scoring that's unique: you get points X_ij (0 <= X_ij <= 3,000) for each little nail you hit on the way down. The cows want to maximize their score on this machine. What is the best score they can achieve?</p>

<p>Here's an example triangle and a good route:</p>

<pre>                    7                        *7

                  3   8                    *3   8

                8   1   0                *8   1   0

              2   7   4   4             2  *7   4   4

            4   5   2   6   5<span id="cke_bm_421E" style="display:none"> </span>         4  *5   2   6   5</pre>

<p>In the sample above, the route from 7 to 3 to 8 to 7 to 5 produces the highest sum: 30. It's not possible to go from 7 to 8 to 8 -- the 8 on the third row is too far away.</p>
